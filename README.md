# BOOK LIBRARY API:

- A simple RESTful API server built with Flask and SQLite that allows you to manage a book library with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

# FEATURES:

- Add new books to the database
- Retrieve all books or a specific one
- Update existing book information
- Delete books from the database
- Uses SQLite as the database (file-based, no setup required)

# TECH STACK:

Backend: Python + Flask
ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy
Database: SQLite
Testing: Postman

# API DOCUMENTATION:

This project includes a custom REST API built using Flask. The API allows users to manage a library of books with basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. It connects to an SQLite database and serves a frontend HTML page where users can interact with the API directly.

There are five main API endpoints:

- GET /books: returns a list of all books in the database.
- GET /books/<id>: returns the details of a specific book by its ID.
- POST /books: allows users to add a new book by sending JSON data including title, author, year_published, and genre
- PUT /books/<id>: allows users to update the details of an existing book using its ID and sending new data in JSON format.
- DELETE /books/<id>: deletes the book with the specified ID.

All endpoints return data in JSON format. To test these APIs, users can either use tools like Postman, curl commands in a terminal, or the included HTML frontend (index.html) which interacts with the API through JavaScript.

When deployed on a platform like Render, you must replace "http://localhost:5000" with your deployed site URL e.g., any "site url you will host it on" , i used render specifically. not changing the url will result in incorrect result as the frontend will not interact with the API as you want due to difference in the addresses.

ðŸ§ª API Testing with Keploy + CI/CD Integration:
We used [Keploy](https://keploy.io) to automatically generate and run test scenarios for our Book Library API.

ðŸ§ª CI/CD Workflow
CI/CD testing was set up using **GitHub Actions**, and API testing runs on every push to `main`.
